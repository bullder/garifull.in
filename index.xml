SKILLS I&amp;rsquo;m fluent with PHP including the modern changes. SQL databases optimisation is a very usual thing for me. I have no friction to participate in improvements related to the frontend parts of project written in javascript. I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with Vue.js and React. I used MongoDB and Laravel for my pet projects but MySQL and Symfony is still my main tools for achieving goals.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://garifull.in/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2019 14:23:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://garifull.in/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>Do you remember how much times during you developer career you forgot to add some IDE files to .gitignore?
