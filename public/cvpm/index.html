                    <h2 id=skills>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a person who likes to find ways to make things smoother and coming up with creative ideas that push the
                        limits.
                        I also like thinking outside the box and trying new things to make projects better.<br>
                        I'm skilled in optimising application performance, making them run smoothly and fixing complex problems that
                        happen in real use.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h2 id=collaboration>COLLABORATION AND IMPACT</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I mentor, I understand that giving knowledge is just the start; helping others truly
                        understand and use that knowledge takes more work, but the outcome is valuable.
                        Because of this, I've built a strong network of former colleagues.
                        I aid my business connections and developer friends in organising startups, using my networking
                        ability and technical advice to help them succeed.<br>
                        I enjoy looking at code and talking with colleagues about ways to make things better.
                        I think Clean Code is important, not just as a concept, but as a way to make solutions strong
                        and reliable.
                        I teach my developers this idea. Sharing knowledge is something I love; it makes me better and
                        the team stronger.
                        When we all work together, the goals we reach are even greater.<br>

                        I think CI/CD is a way to make things run faster for businesses and their time-to-market
                        objectives.
                        I like writing postmortems after solving tough problems to share what I learned with others.
                        It helps me organise what I know and think about how to prevent similar issues later on.
                        I'm also good at working with others, and I'm open to new technologies.<br>
                    </p>
