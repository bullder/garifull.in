                <h2 id=skills>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m fluent with modern web development process.<br/>
                    I particularly enjoy working on my projects when I can offer to business fastest and best ways to achieve business goals.
                    I'm a big fan of cutting corners when it's appropriate, I also like to offer unconventional solutions and find out-of-the-box solutions.<br/>
                    DB optimisation and resolving complicated productions issues is a very usual thing for me.<br/>
                    Using front-end frameworks as VueJs and React doesn't cause me any problems but my main focus is backend and infra for my web projects.
                    For me, programming language and frameworks are just a tools to achieve business goals, so if I feel it's necessary, I'd rather use Python or Go Lang as more appropriate technologies if it will make the solution faster and more reliable but my favourite technology for solving issues is still PHP.<br/>
                    Rich experience of testing code in functional and unit way on a different levels including e2e regression tests in hybrid service ecosystems.<br/>
                    Good understanding of services architecture in a modern way (async, queues, microservices). Obviously it's amazing to plan solutions that will be reliable, extensible and easy to maintain for long term.<br/>
                </p>
                <h2 id=collaboration>COLLABORATION AND IMPACT</h2>
                <p>
                    In mentoring it is important for me not only to deliver knowledge, but I am also well aware that it takes much more effort to maintain and assimilate this knowledge in practice, but the result is worth it, as result I have reach network of ex-colleague, so usually I'm organising some startups between my business friends and developer lads simply providing them my networking skill and technical advisory.<br/>
                    I like to review code and discuss opportunities for improvements with colleagues.<br/>
                    I believe that Clean Code is not just an idea but the way to achieve fault-tolerant and bulletproof solutions. And that's what I try to convey to my developers. I love sharing knowledge, for me it is a way to strengthen my capabilities, because when you are not only you, but also a team focused on the result, then the achieved goals become bigger.<br/>
                    CI/CD is not just a modern approach to me, but a way to reduce time to market for business features<br/>
                    A special pleasure for me is writing a postmortems as a result of solving non-trivial problems in order to share the gained experience with colleagues, it helps me to structure the gained knowledge once again and to analyse how similar situations can be avoided in the future.<br/>
                    I am a person who can blend seamlessly in with others. Open-minded to the new technologies.<br/>
