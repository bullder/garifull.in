                <h2 id=skills>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>
                    I know a lot about modern web development and enjoy making things work well and fast for businesses.
                    I'm good at finding ways to make things smoother and coming up with creative ideas that push the limits.
                    I also like thinking outside the box and trying new things to make projects better.<br>

                    I'm skilled in optimising databases, making them run smoothly and fixing complex problems that happen in real use.
                    I'm comfortable using front-end tools like VueJs and React, but I'm really focused on making the back-end and the systems behind websites work well.<br>

                    For me, the coding tools are just ways to get business things done, so I'd use Python or Go for better speed and reliability if needed, but my favourite problem-solving tool is still PHP.
                    I have plenty of experience with functional and unit tests, including e2e regression in hybrid service ecosystems.<br>

                    I know how to set up and use modern architecture with async, queues, and microservices.
                    I'm really proficient at designing solutions that work well, grow well, and are simple to maintain.<br>

                </p>
                <h2 id=collaboration>COLLABORATION AND IMPACT</h2>
                <p>
                    When I mentor, I understand that giving knowledge is just the start; helping others truly understand and use that knowledge takes more work, but the outcome is valuable.
                    Because of this, I've built a strong network of former colleagues.
                    I aid my business connections and developer friends in organising startups, using my networking ability and technical advice to help them succeed.<br>
                    I enjoy looking at code and talking with colleagues about ways to make things better.
                    I think Clean Code is important, not just as a concept, but as a way to make solutions strong and reliable.
                    I teach my developers this idea. Sharing knowledge is something I love; it makes me better and the team stronger.
                    When we all work together, the goals we reach are even greater.<br>

                    I think CI/CD is a way to make things run faster for businesses and their time-to-market objectives.
                    I like writing postmortems after solving tough problems to share what I learned with others.
                    It helps me organise what I know and think about how to prevent similar issues later on.
                    I'm also good at working with others, and I'm open to new technologies.<br>
                </p>
